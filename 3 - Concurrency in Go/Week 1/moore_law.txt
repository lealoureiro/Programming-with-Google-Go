The Moore's law is the observation that says the number of transistors in CPU/Processor doubles every two years aproximate.

The physical limiations are:

Thermal limits: Because of temperature exccess that we can dissipate anymore the transitors inside CPU can't double anymore.
Transistor Leakage: The transistors are so small that can start leak energy.
Power problem: The power increases as transistor increases which is a problem nowadays with portable devices.
Wall limit: We can find material so thin and small to make a proper wall inside transistor.
Voltage scaling: With Voltage scaling reduces dynamic power consumption. Also is limited do noise and voltage threshold.
